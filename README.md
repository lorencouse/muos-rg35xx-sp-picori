# muos-rg35xx-sp-picori

Packaging for **Project Picori** (*The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap* PC port)
as an installable port for the Anbernic RG35XX SP running muOS.

The player-facing documentation is [`port/picori/README.md`](port/picori/README.md).
This file is about building the package.

## Build

```sh
./build.sh 1.0.0            # -> dist/picori-1.0.0.zip
```

`build.sh` fetches the `tmc_pc` binary from a tagged release on the fork,
verifies it against a pinned SHA-256, stages `port/` around it and zips the
result. The 59 MB binary is deliberately not in git.

To build against a local compile instead:

```sh
TMC_BINARY=/path/to/tmc_pc ./build.sh 1.0.0-dev
```

## Test

```sh
./tools/test-launcher.sh
```

Runs the launcher against a sandboxed PortMaster/sysfs/weston/PipeWire stub and
asserts that the CPU governor and the forced PipeWire clock are restored on all
three exit paths (missing ROM, clean quit, killed mid-game). Both of those are
system-wide settings, so a teardown bug misconfigures the device until reboot;
this suite caught exactly that twice. Run it after touching the launcher.

## Layout

The zip unpacks into `ports/`, following PortMaster convention:

```
Legend of Zelda - The Minish Cap.sh    launcher
picori/
  tmc_pc                  fetched at build time, not in git
  config.json             port settings (device-tuned defaults)
  tmc_pc.gptk             pad -> virtual keyboard map
  picori-weston.ini       320x240 X screen, 2x compositor upscale
  port.json               PortMaster metadata
  gameinfo.xml            frontend metadata
  README.md               player documentation
  version.txt             stamped by build.sh
  baserom.gba             SUPPLIED BY THE USER, never shipped
```

## Where the binary comes from

Upstream is [999sian/tmc](https://github.com/999sian/tmc) (GPL-3.0-or-later).
The shipped build is the fork
[lorencouse/tmc @ `rg35xx-sp-audio-ui`](https://github.com/lorencouse/tmc/tree/rg35xx-sp-audio-ui),
five commits ahead of `master`, all of them handheld-class fixes:

| Commit | What |
|--------|------|
| LINEAR resampler | Upstream's SINC resampler costs a whole A53 core here — music played at half speed |
| 44.1 kHz synth | The SP codec's "48000" clock runs fast; 44.1 kHz is the honest rate |
| `TMC_UI_SCALE` | The ImGui overlay is fixed 380–620 px wide, off-screen on a 320 px display |
| `aspect_mode: "stretch"` | Fill a 4:3 panel instead of letterboxing the native 3:2 frame |
| `TMC_AUDIO_TRACE` | Logs frames/s pulled and the negotiated device format |

None of these are SP-specific hacks, so the intent is to upstream them and go
back to shipping official release builds. Until then this repo pins a fork tag.

## Runtime requirements

Determined by reading the ELF directly:

- **glibc ≥ 2.34**, `libstdc++` with `GLIBCXX_3.4.30` (GCC 12)
- Dynamic deps: `libpng16`, `libEGL`, `libGLESv2`, `libgomp`, `libstdc++`
- SDL3 is statically linked — which is *why* the launcher must use westonwrap
  gfxmode `system`: crusty hooks any binary exporting SDL symbols as if it
  were SDL2 and crashes this one.
- PortMaster runtime `weston_pkg_0.2.squashfs`
- PipeWire (the launcher forces `clock.force-rate 44100` / `force-quantum 768`
  on the system graph for the session, and restores them on exit)

That glibc floor is higher than any port currently in PortMaster's catalogue
(the highest `min_glibc` across its 1,422 entries is 2.32), so older CFW are
unlikely to run this binary at all.

## Status

Tier A: installable. Not yet submitted to PortMaster.

- [x] Launcher hardened with trap-based teardown (governor + PipeWire settings
      are system-wide; a crash previously left them applied until reboot)
- [x] Game runs backgrounded under `wait` so signals are not deferred
- [x] ROM presence + SHA-1 validation across all three regions
- [x] First-launch asset-extraction notice (~2 min on a still screen)
- [x] `port.json` / `gameinfo.xml` / player README
- [x] `screenshot.png` (captured from the device) and `cover.png`
- [x] Tagged release [`v0.8.3-sp1`](https://github.com/lorencouse/tmc/releases/tag/v0.8.3-sp1)
      on the fork; `build.sh` fetches and verifies from it
- [x] Reproducible build verified from a fresh clone
- [x] Shipped configs verified byte-identical to the working device install
- [ ] End-to-end install test from the zip on a clean card
- [ ] PortMaster submission → **Multiverse**
      ([PortsMaster-MV/PortMaster-MV-New](https://github.com/PortsMaster-MV/PortMaster-MV-New)),
      not the main repo: every Nintendo-decomp port (Ship of Harkinian,
      sm64coopdx, zelda3) lives there.

Known cosmetic gaps, from the device log: `SDL_CreateGPUDevice` fails and the
port falls back to software rendering, and no TTS backend exists — so
`gpu_raster` and `tts_enabled` in the shipped `config.json` are inert here.

## Licence

The port binary is GPL-3.0-or-later (Project Picori). The launcher and
packaging in this repo are released under the same terms — see `LICENSE`.

No game data is included or distributed. *The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap*
is property of Nintendo.
